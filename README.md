# Guess-the-Number Game
This simple Python program is an implementation of a classic "Guess-the-Number" game. Players are prompted to enter an upper and lower bound for the range of possible numbers, and the program randomly selects a target number within that range. The player then has a limited number of guesses to determine the correct number.

Instructions:
Run the program.
Enter the upper and lower bounds for the range of numbers.
The program will randomly select a number within the specified range.
You have a limited number of guesses, calculated based on the logarithm of the range size.
Enter your guesses, and the program will provide feedback on whether the guess is too low or too high.
Keep guessing until you either correctly identify the number or exhaust your allowed guesses.
Code Overview:
The program uses the random module to generate a random number within the user-specified range.
The number of guesses is calculated based on the logarithm (base 2) of the range size using the math module.
The player is prompted to enter guesses within the specified range.
Feedback is provided after each guess, indicating whether the guess is too low, too high, or correct.

# Word Guessing Game
Welcome to the Word Guessing Game! This Python program challenges players to guess a word selected randomly from a predefined list. Here's how the game works:

Instructions:
Run the program.
Enter your name when prompted.
You have 12 turns to guess the characters in the randomly selected word.
After each guess, the program will display the correctly guessed characters and reveal any incorrect guesses.
Continue guessing until you correctly identify all the characters or run out of turns.
Code Overview:
The game randomly selects a word from a predefined list.
Players input their guesses, attempting to uncover the hidden characters in the word.
The program provides feedback after each guess, showing correctly guessed characters and indicating incorrect guesses.
The game ends when the player correctly guesses all the characters or runs out of turns.

# Screenshot Capture and Save Project
Overview
This Python project utilizes the pyscreenshot library to capture the screen, display the captured screenshot, and save it to a file. The program allows users to quickly capture their screen and store the screenshot for future reference.

Features
Capture Screen: Utilizes the pyscreenshot library to capture the entire screen.

Display Screenshot: The captured screenshot is displayed using the default image viewer on the system.

Save Screenshot: Saves the captured screenshot as a PNG file with the filename "pooja.png".


















The game ends when the player correctly guesses the number or reaches the maximum number of allowed guesses.
